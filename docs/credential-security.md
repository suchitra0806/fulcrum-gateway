# Credential Security

ax-cli includes built-in credential fingerprinting and honeypot detection to
protect agent workspaces from unauthorized access.

> **Future device-trust model:** fingerprinting is useful for anomaly detection,
> but the target trust anchor is a registered device public key, not a reusable
> user-token hash. See [DEVICE-TRUST-001](../specs/DEVICE-TRUST-001/spec.md) for
> the proposed device approval and request-signing model.

## Fingerprinting

Every CLI request sends non-sensitive fingerprint headers to the aX platform:

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `X-AX-FP` | SHA-256 hash (24 chars) | Composite hash of working directory + hostname + OS user. Changes if the credential is used from a different location. |
| `X-AX-FP-Token` | SHA-256 hash (16 chars) | Hash of the PAT itself. Detects token modification. |
| `X-AX-FP-OS` | e.g. `Darwin/25.3.0` | Operating system and version. Public info. |
| `X-AX-FP-Arch` | e.g. `arm64` | CPU architecture. Public info. |

**No sensitive data is sent.** Hostnames, usernames, and directory paths are
hashed into a single composite fingerprint. The server never sees the raw
values — it only compares hashes across requests.

### What the server can detect

- **Copied config** — `.ax/config.toml` moved to a different directory.
  The `X-AX-FP` hash changes because the directory component changed.

- **Stolen token** — PAT used from a different machine. The `X-AX-FP`
  hash changes because hostname and user are different.

- **Token replay** — Same token used from two locations simultaneously.
  The server sees two different `X-AX-FP` values for the same `credential_id`.

- **Environment shift** — Same credential suddenly appears on a different
  OS or architecture. May indicate credential exfiltration.

### How detection works

1. On first use, the server stores the fingerprint as the baseline for that credential.
2. On subsequent requests, the server compares the fingerprint.
3. On mismatch, the server logs a security event with the old and new fingerprints.
4. Depending on policy: alert the workspace owner, flag the credential, or auto-revoke.

## Honeypot Keys

ax-cli recognizes credential patterns from other platforms. If a token matching
one of these patterns is used, the CLI immediately alerts the aX platform with
the full fingerprint of whoever triggered it.

### Supported patterns

| Prefix | Provider | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `AKIA` | AWS IAM | `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` |
| `ASIA` | AWS STS | `ASIAXXX...` |
| `ghp_` | GitHub PAT | `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `gho_` | GitHub OAuth | `gho_xxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `ghs_` | GitHub App | `ghs_xxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `sk-` | OpenAI | `sk-proj-xxxx` |
| `sk-ant-` | Anthropic | `sk-ant-xxxx` |
| `xoxb-` | Slack Bot | `xoxb-xxxx` |
| `xoxp-` | Slack User | `xoxp-xxxx` |
| `SG.` | SendGrid | `SG.xxxx` |

### How to use honeypots

1. Generate fake keys that match the patterns above.
2. Plant them in places an attacker would find:
   - `.env` files in repos
   - CI/CD configs
   - Docker images
   - Shared drives or wikis
3. If anyone uses them with ax-cli, the platform gets an instant alert with:
   - Which pattern was triggered (e.g. "aws-iam")
   - Full SHA-256 hash of the token used
   - Fingerprint of the caller (hashed dir/host/user, OS, arch)

### Example: planting a honeypot

```bash
# Create a fake .env that looks like it has real credentials
cat > .env.example << 'EOF'
# AWS credentials (DO NOT COMMIT)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

# aX Platform
AX_TOKEN=axp_u_FAKE.honeypot_key_do_not_use
EOF
```

If a scanner, bot, or attacker extracts `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` and tries to
use it with ax-cli, the platform knows immediately.

## Privacy

- No raw hostnames, usernames, or paths are transmitted
- All identifying information is hashed (SHA-256, truncated)
- OS version and architecture are the only plaintext values — these are
  non-sensitive and publicly observable
- Honeypot alerts fire only when fake credentials are used — legitimate
  users with real `axp_u_` tokens are never flagged by the honeypot system
- The server IP address is available from the request itself (standard HTTP)

## Storing the User PAT at Rest

The user bootstrap PAT (`axp_u_…`) lands at `~/.ax/user.toml` in plaintext by
default. To keep it off the filesystem in plaintext — useful for sync
directories, container layer copies, and multi-assistant workspaces — see
[Store user PAT in an encrypted secret store](scenarios/encrypted-pat-at-rest.md).
The recipes cover dotenvx, sops, and pass; they integrate through the
`AX_TOKEN` environment variable and the `axctl login --print` flag.

## Trusted Setup Agents

Trusted local agents can help configure an agent team after the user completes
`axctl login`, but they should not receive the raw user bootstrap token.

The safe pattern is:

1. User logs in locally with `axctl login`.
2. Trusted setup agent invokes `axctl token mint --save-to --profile`.
3. Backend policy verifies the enrolled user/device context.
4. `axctl` stores one scoped agent PAT per runtime profile.
5. Runtime agents exchange their own PATs for short-lived agent JWTs.

`axctl token mint` hides newly minted PATs by default when it stores them locally.
Use `--print-token` only when a human explicitly needs to copy the token.

## Agent PAT Rotation

The simple loop is: check the keys, mint one replacement, test it, then remove
the old one. Rotation is built from the existing CLI commands instead of
relying on a separate rotate API:

1. `axctl credentials list --json`
2. `axctl credentials audit`
3. `axctl token mint <agent> --audience <same-audience> --expires <days> --save-to <new-token-file> --profile <profile> --no-print-token`
4. `axctl profile verify <profile>`
5. `axctl auth whoami --json`
6. `axctl credentials revoke <old-credential-id>`

The normal target is one active PAT per agent. Two active PATs is acceptable
only during the rotation window. More than two active PATs for one agent should
be treated as a security hygiene issue and cleaned up before issuing another
token.

## Credential Detection Signals

Warnings should come from credential metadata, not guesswork:

- Active keys per agent: warn at two active keys, block or require cleanup above
  two.
- New device or host fingerprint for an existing token.
- New location, IP region, or ASN for an existing token.
- Impossible travel between two token uses.
- Active token with old `last_used_at`.
- Token used against an unexpected audience, space, or bound agent.

These should become normal alerts in the product: tell the user what changed,
which token/agent is involved, when it happened, and the recommended action,
usually "verify this was you" or "revoke the inactive key."

### Same-Location Limit

Device and location fingerprints are useful when a token appears somewhere new.
They are much less useful when a token is used from the expected hashed
location. In that case the hard question is whether the runtime host or user
account is compromised. That is a different threat class: we reduce blast radius
with one agent PAT per agent, mode `0600` token files, profile verification,
short-lived exchanged JWTs, audit logs, and fast revocation, but we should not
claim fingerprinting can detect every same-host compromise.

Local isolation note: a fully trusted shell agent running as the same OS user can
generally read files that the user can read. Device trust and OS secret storage
reduce exposure, but untrusted code still needs process/user-level isolation.
